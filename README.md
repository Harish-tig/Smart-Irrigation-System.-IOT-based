## Overview
Developed as a first-year engineering project, this smart irrigation system utilizes the ESP8266 microcontroller for efficient water management in agriculture. This project could be controlled remotely from anywhere in the world using blynkIOt mobile application or Web page. 

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:**
  - Implemented sensors to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity in real-time.
  - Sensors used include DHT sensor, humidity sensor, and soil moisture sensor.

- **Data Transmission:**
  - Utilized Wi-Fi connectivity to transmit sensor data to a central server or mobile application.

- **Automated Watering Mechanism:**
  - Integrated an automated watering mechanism based on preset moisture thresholds, ensuring optimal irrigation scheduling.

- **Remote Control and Monitoring:**
  - Enabled remote control and monitoring capabilities, allowing users to adjust irrigation settings remotely via a smartphone or web interface.
- **More:**
